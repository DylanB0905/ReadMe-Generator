  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  This is an application that will create a nice and neat readme file from some data that is collected from the user. the problem this app solves is that sometimes people either make a readme but it isnt great or they dont make on at all. so it makes it alot easier to make one
  I created this project to help myself and other developers to be able to make a nice and neat readme file
